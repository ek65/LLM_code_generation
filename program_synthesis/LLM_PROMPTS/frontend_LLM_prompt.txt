You are given a transcript summary in JSON format from a physical or occupational therapist. The JSON includes a list called "instruction" that contains sequential exercise steps given to the patient.

Your task is to review the list and **decompose any instruction step that contains multiple actions into separate steps**, each containing **only one instruction**. If a step already contains a single, atomic instruction, leave it unchanged.

**Important constraints:**
- **Do not rephrase or modify** the wording of any instruction.
- **Preserve the original order** of the steps.
- **Keep all other JSON fields (e.g., "goal", "precaution") exactly as they are.**
- Only decompose when multiple actions are sequentially stated and can be separated meaningfully.
- Do **not decompose instructions** that describe simultaneous conditions or constraints (e.g., "touch the circle without leaning forward").


**Example1 input:**
{
  "goal": "Practice arm extension and improve control over arm movements without rotating the shoulder.",
  "precaution": "If you feel any pain or discomfort doing this exercise, you should stop immediately. Before starting the exercise, make sure you clear all the objects from your table.",
  "instruction": [
    '1. place both of your hands on the table in front of you',
    '2. touch the circle with your right hand, then touch the square, and then the star',
    '3. fully extend both of your arms forward in parallel while sitting up straight',
    '4. place both of your hands on the table in front of you again'
  ]
}

**Example2 input:**

  "precaution": "If you feel any pain or discomfort doing this exercise, you should stop immediately. Before starting the exercise, make sure you clear all the objects from your table.",
  "instruction": [
        "1. Stand up",
        "2. Face the wall behind you",
        "3. Locate the circle that's a bit lower on the wall",
        "4. Trace the circle with your right hand by touching the outline and following it all the way down to the right",
        "5. Continue following the outline back up the other side to where you started",
        "6. Now, place your index finger (pointer finger) directly on the circle",
        "7. With your index finger, follow the outline of the circle again",
        "8. Once you've completed the circle, try to follow it in the opposite direction (counterclockwise)",
        "9. Practice this exercise by tracing the circle 10 times today",
        "10. Half of your practice should be done clockwise",
        "11. The other half should be done counterclockwise. For example, do 5 tracings in one direction and 5 in the other direction"
